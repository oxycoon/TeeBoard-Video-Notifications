<h1>TeeBoard video notification</h1>
In development plugin for TeeBoard to allow the user to show an animation in the notification instead of just a slide-in picture. This is seperate from the development of TeeBoard and this is mostly just a project I'm working on my own for my stream.


<h2>How this works</h2>


<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<b>JQuery</b> - </br>
<b>FitText</b> - </br>
<b>Lettering</b> - </br<
<b>Textillate</b> - Allows for the text animation in the notification </br>
